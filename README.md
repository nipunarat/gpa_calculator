##How GPA is calculated in general

The entire number of grade points obtained is divided by the total number of credit hours attempted to compute your grade point average (GPA). Your grade point average could be anywhere between 0.0 and 4.0. The total grade points are divided by the number credit hours attempted to calculate the GPA of the example student.

Please keep in mind that this grading method varies each university. A dynamic calulation mechanism comes in handy in this situation.
